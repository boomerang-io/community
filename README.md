## Contributing

We welcome all contributions.

### Issue Types
There are 5 types of issues that we have added to the issue templates. Epic and Task are generally reserved for the active development team and related to implementing a Change or Enhancemnet

| Type |	Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| 🐛 Bug Report |	Create a report to help us improve if something isn't working as expected. |
| ✨ Change or Enhancement |	A change or improvement suggestion. |
| 💬 Support or Inquiry |	When help is needed or to track questions. |
| 🚀 Epic | A theme of work that is required to complete the larger goal |
| 🔨 Task | Steps to implement a feature |

### How to Contribute
Like any good development project, we use Pull Requests (PRs) to track code changes. We recommend that if you want to contrubute and implement a fix, change, or enhancement, you do so by linking the PR with an Issue.

Depending on the access there are two ways to contribute

Access to the repository with write ability to create a branch. A PR will be required to merge this branch.

Fork the repository and create a PR to be able to link this to the parent repository and request a merge.

### Commit Messages

The commit message should state the change in 72 characters or less. Additionally we recommend, and require in some repositories, the usage of a commit lint and conventional commit so that we can map these to Release Notes.
