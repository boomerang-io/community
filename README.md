### How to Contribute

Like any good development project, we use Pull Requests (PRs) to track code changes. We recommend that if you want to contrubute and implement a fix, change, or enhancement, you do so by linking the PR with an Issue.

Typically this is achieved by forking the repository and create a PR to be able to link this to the parent repository and request a merge.

### GitHub Issue Types

There are 5 types of issues that we have added to the issue templates. Epic and Task are generally reserved for the active development team and related to implementing a Change or Enhancemnet

| Type                     | Purpose                                                                    |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

| ‚ú® Change or Enhancement | A change or improvement suggestion.                                        |
| üí¨ Support or Inquiry    | When help is needed or to track questions.                                 |
| üöÄ Epic                  | A theme of work that is required to complete the larger goal               |

### Commit Messages

The commit message should state the change in 72 characters or less. Additionally we recommend, and require in some repositories, the usage of a commit lint and conventional commit so that we can map these to Release Notes.
