# Feature Specification Template.

_The purpose of a feature spec is to document intent and implementation, and allow for effective collaboration in a globally distributed team._

_Its best the more concise the feature spec is. This is not an academic paper and should not be designed to create massive overhead. It is also a living document and should evolve over time._
